* add support for the change tracking file?
* make sure descriptor file data is cleaned on close - also if no data files were set!

* make libvmdk_handle_open_extent_data_files_file_io_pool work
* make libvmdk_handle_open_extent_data_files use libvmdk_handle_open_extent_data_files_file_io_pool

* update manuals
  - update vmdkinfo.1
  - add vmdkmount.1
* handle ZERO extents?
* extent file add windows support (encoding)

* get grain data by grain table
  - remove unused functions from libvmdk_extent_table after refactor
* implement libvmdk_handle_set_maximum_number_of_open_handles
* add support for zero-grain table entry support

* code clean up:
  - support and locale functions
* add glob functions?
* debug output

  - add option to print descriptor file data?
  - print dirty status
  - add byte size string support

Tests:
* open close
  - add parent support
* read
  - add parent support
* seek
  - add parent support

* Test images
  - vmdk flat
  - vmdk flat split (done)
  - Monolithic sparse (done)
  - 2GB extent sparse (done)
  - cowd sparse
  - cowd sparse split
  - compressed (done)
